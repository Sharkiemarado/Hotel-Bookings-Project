This is my R Project based on a hotel bookings dataset. 
In it we will explore:
-the likelihood that people with children are most likely to book in advance
-if guests without children might book the most weekend nights
-what distribution type has the most number of bookings
-how many city hotels were booked by travel agencies
-what is the most popular month for high-value bookings
